# Overview

This is my first dive into Android apps.  I focused on learning Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM Architecture, Room, and Flows. The app is simple and is only storing a few items in a DB, but the project was about learning the basics of the mentioned technologies and architecture so that I would have a foundation for later.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to make this application. 

The app is written in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose for the layout and styling. 

Room is used for a local database to store the saved entries. 

A Model, View, View-Model architecture was used (MVVM).

* [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/develop#core-areas)  Tons of reading of the docs for tutorials and technical details of how things work.

# Future Work

I would love to see the project grow. 
* More detailed records kept
* Search functionality
* Suggestions for items that a group of people who are coming would be able to have (IE allergy warnings for your party)
