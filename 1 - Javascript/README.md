# Overview

The goal of this project is to help with a basic understanding of how modern Javascript frameworks (like Vue.js) function. 

This is a very basic and rudamentory version of a Javascript framework designed to help build single page applications. 

It is important to understand the tools we use. Even if this software is never used in production (it likely won't be) it helps to show how frameworks like Vue.js parse the DOM and add functionality to HTML without writing all the javascript required to modify the dom.
